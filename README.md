# E-Commerce_Sales_Forecasting_using_Machine_Learning
E-commerce sales forecasting predicts future sales based on historical data, market trends, and various other factors. Traditional methods often need to capture the complexity of the ever-changing online market. Hereâ€™s where Machine Learning steps in, transforming the way businesses make informed decisions.


E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales in the e-commerce domain using machine learning techniques. The dataset used comes from an e-commerce platform and contains valuable insights into customer behaviors, temporal patterns, and geographical distribution. The predictive model employs the CatBoost regression algorithm, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using Bayesian Optimization.

Data Loading and Libraries
This section outlines the initial setup, including the libraries used for data analysis and machine learning. It describes the process of loading the e-commerce data from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Here, the README discusses the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. It covers handling missing values, converting date columns, and addressing canceled invoices. The cleaning process also includes filtering data based on stock codes, descriptions, and customer information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This section highlights the exploratory data analysis, which involves visualizing various aspects of the data. It provides insights into stock codes, descriptions, customer behaviors, and the geographical distribution of customers.

Feature Engineering
The README explains how additional features are derived to enhance the dataset. These new features are related to daily product sales, revenue, and temporal patterns. It also covers the exploration and preprocessing of unit prices and quantities.

Model Development
This section introduces the predictive model used in the project - the CatBoost regression model. It outlines the process of defining hyperparameters and performing hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization.

Time Series Cross-Validation
The README explains the implementation of time series cross-validation, a crucial step in evaluating the model's performance over different time periods.

Multiple Model Management
This section describes the management of multiple CatBoost models. It covers the training and evaluation of models using various features and hyperparameters.

Visualization and Interpretability
The final section focuses on visualization and interpretability. It mentions the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model results, hyperparameter optimization, and feature importance.
