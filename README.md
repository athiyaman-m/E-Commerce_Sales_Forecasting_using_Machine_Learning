# E-Commerce Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales in the e-commerce domain using machine learning techniques. The dataset used comes from an e-commerce platform, providing insights into customer behaviors, temporal patterns, and geographical distribution. The predictive model employs the CatBoost regression algorithm, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using Bayesian Optimization.
